Technologies Used: 
    HTML
    CSS

I have been tasked with making this webpage for a marketing management company more accessible. 
I replaced the non-semantic HTML elements with semantic HTML elements. 
I added accessible alt attributes to image and icon elements.
I established a more structured style for the organization and positioning of HTML elements.
I added a concise, descriptive title element.

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
